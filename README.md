# ListView2
Practicing ListView on Android Studio, using Resource Arrays to fill it.

This is an example of how to use the ListView component that I am studying in Android classes in the Java Technology postgraduate course at UTFPR (Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná).

In this example, I learned with my teacher how to fill a ListView using Resource Arrays.
